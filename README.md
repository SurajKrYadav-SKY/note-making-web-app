Title: Notes App

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a web-based application where users can write and manage their notes. It allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and search for notes.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the structure of the web page.
Bootstrap: For styling and making the web page look more appealing.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity to the web page.
Local Storage: To store the notes on the user's device so they can access them even after closing the browser.
Main Features:

Navigation Bar: The project starts with a navigation bar at the top of the page. It includes the title "Notes App" and a search bar for finding notes quickly.

Add a Note: Users can add a new note by entering a title and content in the designated fields. Clicking the "Add Note" button stores the note on their device.

Your Notes Section: Below the add note section, there's a space to display all the notes. Each note is shown as a card with a title, content, and buttons for editing or deleting.

Edit Notes: Users can edit their existing notes by clicking the "Edit" button on a note card. This opens an edit form that allows them to modify both the title and content. After editing, they can save the changes.

Delete Notes: Users can remove notes they no longer need by clicking the "Delete Note" button on a note card. This permanently deletes the note from their list.

Search Functionality: The search bar in the navigation allows users to find specific notes by typing keywords. The project will filter and display only the notes that match the search terms.

How It Works:

When a user adds a note, the JavaScript code collects the title and content, creates an object to represent the note, and stores it in the local storage of their device.

The showNotes() function retrieves the notes from local storage, creates HTML elements to display them, and appends them to the web page.

Users can edit a note by clicking the "Edit" button, which replaces the content of the note card with an editable form. After editing, clicking "Save" updates the note.

To delete a note, the user clicks the "Delete Note" button, which removes it from local storage and updates the displayed notes.

The search functionality listens for user input in the search bar. It checks if the title or content of each note matches the search query and hides or shows the notes accordingly.

In summary, this project provides users with a simple and user-friendly way to manage their notes. It's a web application that utilizes HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and local storage to create, edit, delete, and search for notes.
